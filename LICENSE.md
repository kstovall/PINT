Placeholder for a license file for PINT.  

What should our license be?  Note that work by government employees (e.g. Paul Ray) 
[cannot be copyrighted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_status_of_work_by_the_U.S._government).  
According to [this reference](http://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/#Q:_Can_government_employees_contribute_code_to_open_source_software_projects.3F), this means:
> If a government employee enhances or modifies a (copyrighted) open source software program, 
> the resulting work is a “joint work” (see 17 USC § 101) which is partially copyrighted and partially public domain. 
> The resulting joint work as a whole is protected by the copyrights of the non-government authors and 
> may be released according to the terms of the original open-source license.

Portions of the code (e.g. appdirs) are covered by the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
