Usage
=====

Start using PINT by going through the PINT_walkthough.ipynb_ IPython notebook.

To see how it is used programmatically, look at examples/fit_NGC6440E.py_

You can also run it from the command line with::

  pintempo --plot parfile.par timfile.tim

Use -h to get help. This is not fully developed yet, so extensions to this
(like a nice GUI) are most welcome.
